**Project Description:**
The project involves building a simple encryption and decryption program, often referred to as a "cipher." In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption, which involves transforming plaintext (unencrypted data) into cipher-text (encrypted data), and vice versa. I first worked on Caesar cipher before changing adjusting the code to encrypt and decrypt as a Vigenere cipher, which is more secure. Though both aren’t in extensive use in today’s cryptography, they make for good fundamental lessons in cryptography.

The **Caesar cipher** is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques used in cryptography. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it to encrypt his private correspondence.

**Vigenère Cipher** is an extension of the Caesar cipher that uses a keyword to determine the shift value for each letter in the plaintext. This makes the Vigenère cipher more secure than the Caesar cipher, as it introduces variability in the encryption process based on the keyword. It was named after Blaise de Vigenere, a cryptographer in the 16th Century.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
1.	**Understanding Python building blocks:** The project progressed gradually from simple Python concepts to complex ones while progressing with the projects goal of building a cipher. Learned about variables, operatorss, comparison operators, declaring a function, using default argument, conditional statement and others.
2.	**String Manipulation:** Learned various string manipulation techniques in Python. This includes methods for accessing individual characters in a string, slicing strings, concatenating strings, and more.
3.	**Understanding Ciphers:** By building a cipher, I have gained insight into how basic encryption algorithms work. This involves understanding substitution ciphers, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter at a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
4.	**Algorithm Implementation:** Implementing a cipher involves understanding the logic behind encryption and decryption algorithms and translating that logic into Python code. This includes writing functions to encrypt and decrypt messages based on the chosen cipher algorithm.
5.	**Problem-Solving Skills:** Throughout the project, I encountered various challenges and obstacles where I learned more about using problem-solving skills to overcome. This involves debugging code, optimizing algorithms, and ensuring the program works correctly in different scenarios.
6.	**Documentation and Presentation:** Writing clear and concise documentation for your code is an essential skill in software development. You might have learned how to document your code effectively, explain the purpose of functions and variables, and provide examples of usage.
